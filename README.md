# React-Lucid
A devtool for React-GraphQl developers.

React-Lucid is a React / GraphQl DevTool designed for helping developers debug their React applications that depend on GraphQL resources more efficiently. React-Lucid allows you to visualize the component hierarchy of your React application and your GraphQL schema, queries, and mutations side by side, making development a breeze.
